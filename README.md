# Anomaly-Detection-Framework

This enabled all the scorecard report owners in my team to use this framework on the datasets which are being fed in to their reports/dashboards to check for any bad data, anomalous behaviour, interesting insights on the KPIs in their data & provide the end user with automated mail alerts for the same.
